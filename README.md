# 🤖 Projects on AI

Welcome to my **AI Projects Portfolio**!  
This repository contains a collection of my AI projects built using **Python**, **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, **Computer Vision**, and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.

Each project is practical, hands-on, and focused on solving real-world problems — from detecting faces and emotions to recognizing road signs and generating titles from text!
